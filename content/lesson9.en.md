# Advanced Web Security Quiz

This lesson covers advanced web security concepts and includes an interactive quiz to test your knowledge.

## What You'll Learn

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Understanding parameterized queries
- **XSS Mitigation**: Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based defense mechanisms
- **Authentication Best Practices**: Multi-factor authentication and session management

## Key Concepts

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention
Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods instead of string concatenation.

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG (vulnerable)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'

-- ✅ CORRECT (safe)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1
```

### 2. XSS Mitigation
Implement proper output encoding and Content Security Policy headers.

### 3. CSRF Protection
Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
