# What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?

CSRF tricks a user’s browser into submitting unwanted actions on a web application where they’re authenticated.

## How to Defend Against CSRF
- Use CSRF tokens in forms
- Set SameSite cookies
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions

**Remember:** CSRF exploits trust that a site has in a user’s browser.
