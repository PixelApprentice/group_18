## 🌟 What Makes SEKUR Different

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Our content breaks down complex cybersecurity concepts into easy-to-understand explanations, making it beginner-friendly.  
- **User-Friendly Experience:** The platform combines learning and practice seamlessly, unlocking challenges only after users demonstrate understanding via quizzes.  
- **Localized Accessibility:** We plan to provide educational materials in **Amharic and other Ethiopian local languages** to make cybersecurity education accessible to a broader audience.  (Future Plan)
- **Focused on Practical Skills:** Unlike many platforms that focus solely on theory, SEKUR emphasizes hands-on simulations of real-world vulnerabilities in a safe environment.  
- **Open and Expandable:** Designed to grow with community contributions and feature additions like AI chatbots,supporting local languages, leaderboards, and certificates.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add challenge pages for all OWASP Top 10
- User accounts with saved progress
- Scoreboard and leaderboard
- AI chatbot to answer students' security questions
- Certificates/badges for completion
- **Localization of educational content in Amharic and other Ethiopian local languages**
